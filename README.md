Within this repository, you'll find comprehensive datasets capturing the time series dynamics of aboveground vegetation biomass. Coupled with this data are Python scripts tailored for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modeling, implementing a range of forecasting methodologies as outlined in "Extending Multi-Output Methods for Long-Term Biomass Time-Series Forecasting using CNN." 

Expanding upon established techniques documented in prior literature—such as Recursive, Direct, Direct-Recursive, DIRMO, and MIMO—this study pioneers two innovative approaches. The first, RECMO, amalgamates Recursive and MIMO strategies, while the second, DirRecMO, synthesizes DirRec with MIMO methodologies. These advancements promise enhanced accuracy and efficiency in biomass forecasting, pushing the boundaries of predictive analytics in ecological research.
