### Extending Multi-Output Methods for Long-Term Aboveground Biomass Time Series Forecasting using Convolutional Neural Networks
##### Efrain Noa-Yarasca, Javier M. Osorio Leyton, and Jay Angerer

This repository hosts comprehensive datasets comprising time series data pertaining to aboveground vegetation biomass. It also provides Python code for implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, employing a range of forecasting techniques elucidated in the paper titled "Extending Multi-Output Methods for Long-Term Biomass Time-Series Forecasting using CNN." In addition to established methods documented in previous literature—including Recursive, Direct, Direct-Recursive, DIRMO, and MIMO—this study introduces two innovative methodologies: RECMO, a fusion of Recursive and MIMO strategies, and DirRecMO, a synthesis of DirRec and MIMO techniques. These advancements aim to enhance the accuracy and efficacy of biomass forecasting methodologies.
